                <p class="text-center text-light-gray text-md-justify">Let’s be honest, solo driving a 3500-4500 Pound Electric car with a range of 300-400 miles per charge, to our office 15-20 miles away every day, isn’t a sustainable way to travel. While we all agree that the future is electric, we must
                    also be practical to the ground realties of our electric grid supply. With the bulk of the electricity still being generated from fossil fuels, the electric car isn’t as green as you think. So to build a truly green electric car, we
                    must right size the electric car, to suit the bulk of the requirement, which is the everyday use. The everyday use of the car is solo, and small distances. </p>
                <p class="text-center text-light-gray text-md-justify">We must build to that, to truly be a sustainable alternative. With the right size of the vehicle itself, & the right amount of range on offer in the car, so that we don’t over build the size of the car itself, and also over build the range
                    of the car, and render an electric car unsustainable.</p>
